Hammer & Meißel is a keytracked polyphonic modal filter (and more).

Every voice has:
1. An ADSR Envelope Generator
2. A modal filter and a formant filter in parallel
3. A comb filter
4. A lowpass filter

The formant filter is the only one that isn't keytracked.
Use it to add fixed frequency partials!

You can play the keytracked filters with
1. The key selector
2. polyphonic MIDI inputs

Dial in the noise synth, if you want the effect to act more like a synthesizer!

Create your own modal materials:
1. Drag Partials
2. Drag n Drop a sample onto the material editor
3. Explore the functions in the dropdown menues, 'Create' and 'Process'

Below the material editor you can further tweak its character:
1. Transpose any keytracked filter (in respect to the selected xen scale)
2. Add mod depth and stereo width to the modal parameters
3. Modal parameters: 'Blend, Spreizung, Harmonie, Kraft and Reso'
4. Comb parameters: 'Feedback', 'Unison'
5. Lowpass parameter: 'Damp'

The Mod Envelope synthesizes one of 3 modulators:
1. Temposync ADSR envelope generator
2. Envelope follower
3. Perlin noise randomizer

Modalize Your Sound With Hammer & Meißel! :)
